    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I did not have to do any persevering this week because it was just telling our teacher how much we knew about internet safety.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I had to question if everything people were saying was true. I do not think that nearly everyone watches 18 rated movies online.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I did not look over at the person next to me for information that I did not know because this lesson was all about the basics of E-Safety and how much you personally knew and not what you and your classmates thought.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>My page was filled up on google docs and I was satisfied that I had learnt the basics of E-Safety and knew more about how to stay safe online.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I listened to what my classmates had to say and from engaging when our teacher was talking, I learnt a lot more than i would have if I was constantly whispering to a friend.</td>

    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Since most of the lesson was talking about E-Safety I didn't have to do much things better. If there was one thing it would be to add pictures of the websites in my google docs about E-Safety.</td>
