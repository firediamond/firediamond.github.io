  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I had to work out what to do with my flags in my game. I wanted to make a clone of on flag but then  this didn't work. I realised that the easiest way was to create lots of sprites that can broadcast different levels.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I questioned the fact that my broadcasting wasn’t working when my character touched the sprite. I questioned what I had done wrong and found out that I had to put a forever block around the code.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>When I was working on my problems I didn't’ ask a friend to "help" me and worked out my problems one by one.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>My game is really progressing and now I have 9 levels out of 10. It looks pleasing to me and I have got friends and family to try it out. I got some very helpful feedback.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I worked as hard as I could in the lesson and my game looks well built from this hard work.</td>
