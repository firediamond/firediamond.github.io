    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I didn't have to persevere whilst working, but it was difficult to accept that people can influence you very easily. We get almost all of our news from online now, and it can be difficult to know if what you are reading is the truth.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>In this section of our topic we need to question everything. We need to know where our source is coming from. We canâ€™t always be sure of anyone. We even have to question what our teacher says to us. Never just believe something that you see on the news. Always ask yourself if it sounds true and who is telling me this information? And who is telling them that information?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I asked my own questions and put my hand up to answer questions with my opinion.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I am happy now that I understand how manipulative media can be and that we always need to question our source. This is a useful piece of knowledge for me to have.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I concentrated and listened well in that lesson as I considered it important. This helped me understand more about our topic.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>There was not much in this lesson as there was a lot of talking. If there was one thing it would to have accepted quicker that I had probably been manipulated by the media before. This shocked me more than I would have expected.</td>
