    <td>I was quite happy with the feedback given to me by my peers. Here is what they said:
Your Identity Map is very vibrant and it’s very informative. You added lots of images to show everything, which made it look even better. It would’ve been better if you made the images a little more on the paper.

I really like your work because you have really put in a lot of effort and have got a lot of good content.

You have explained your background and where you lived, and have written about what you want to do in the future       			khalil  

Very neatly presented with loads of relevant information.

All the information you wrote was very good and you set out your map very neatly. I think you wrote your title very neatly and so I think you could have done the same with your name.

I think you have laid out your work very well and written about all the things you needed to. You have a good image for each point and your work is pleasing to the eye and clearly took you sometime. The one thing that would make it better would be to make it clear what the relation is with the countries.

You have gone into a lot of detail on what you like and who you are. The pictures are good and shows all aspects of it. Finally I think it is very clear and is very neat.

Shay- There is lots of information and colour on this map. It is very neat and has clear sections.

Your poster was very neat and colourful which I like.

You have included a lot of information about yourself and it is very colourful and creative which is very good.

This is great in the design aspect and there is lots of writing very good (= 

This is an extremely good piece of work with great design and artistic skills. I really like how you used a lot of colours and made the pictures go off the edge of the page. Also, you included a lot of detail in the writing, so an all round good job!

I think the colour and pictures are really good and there is loads of info.

I think that your work is extremely colourful and includes all the necessary information. To improve you could discuss in more depth as to why you wish to become an architect.

You used lots of information and a sufficient amount of pictures. You could have made the title smaller and used more information.

You have used a lot of information about yourself and have used a lot of colour which makes your work stand out.

You are very open about yourself and you have great hobbies. You have a great taste in art and I think you should carry on you are also very sociable.

I think this is an amazing, colourful and interesting piece of work you included every requirement this is the best piece of work I have seen.

The title looks amazing and a lot of detailed writing well done barney.

The comments were all very helpful to me as it shows where I could have improved and where I did well. However, I am slightly unhappy with the comment that states “You could have made the title smaller and used more information” as I put in a lot of effort in making the title colourful and big so that it stands out and I did add a lot of information. That is why I am not happy with that comment. Apart from that they were useful and kind.</td>
