    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I first went to a website that said it could do a reverse image search for you. However this only came up with many related images and nothing useful to me. But then I found out, with a quick google search, that if you hold on an image and drag it into the box that comes up, you can do a reverse image search on google. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I had to question why google only took me to a load of related images as well the first time I did the search. This was because the image was linked to no site at all. </td>

    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I was working by myself at home and did not ask my parents if they could "help" me with my work.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I found out quite a lot about the tiger image that I searched up. First of all it came from Point Defiance zoo and aquarium. This zoo and aquarium is located in Tacoma, Washington, USA. it opened in 1905 and is on the coast of America.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>To find this information out, I had to concentrate on my reverse search and how I completed it. You can also go onto the website that the image came from for more information on it.</td>

    <td>I would have enjoyed a bit more of a challenge because I only had to look at a few websites before I found out how to do a reverse image search. However it is quite interesting finding out where the pictures that you look at on google or safari come from. I also could  have looked at the website of the zoo to find out more about my picture.</td>
