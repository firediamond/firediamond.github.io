  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I had to figure out how to make a shop and new coloured triangles for my game. I was thinking that I could make a clone of an original triangle but when I did that it broke my game. I then realised that the easiest way to do it was to add new triangle sprites which looked different and change the costume of the original triangle.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I had to question whether I should try and make a shop because I didn't think that there was an easy way to make coins go up or down. But I figured out that I just had to use a variable and some operators for the coins to work. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I was not asking for help from my neighbor in the lesson and was persevering and questioning without any prompting. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>This is the best scratch game I have ever produced and now that it is shared it has 84 views. I also enjoy playing my own game.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I was working quietly in the lesson and really trying to focus on my own work and make it look as good as it could be.</td>

    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>There was not much that could have gone better in my learning and the lesson was very helpful for my creation. If there was one thing that would be to not take so much time choosing colours for my triangles.</td>
