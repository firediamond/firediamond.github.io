  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>There was a lot that I didn't know how to do at the start. I first started by referring back to one of my old projects. This was for an efficient code for movement and speed of a sprite. Then I needed to figure out how to add a sort of gravity to my sprite. For this I went to another platform game that I knew on Scratch. This had the code I needed but it wasn’t in the perfect form for my game. I had to understand the code in order to make it fit my game. This I knew and the code is progressing. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I questioned the fact that the code for the "Gravity" didn’t work first time. I then worked out that I had to change parts of it for my game.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I worked this out myself and the part of understanding code of another game and using it was completely my own idea.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>When I looked back on my game I thought that it was simple but effective and it looked pleasing. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I engaged in the lesson by getting lots of work that needed to be done in school done. I also found this part of computer programming fun and enjoyed this lesson a lot.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I could have remembered how to use the code for moving a sprite efficiently and that would have saved me a lot of time. I also could have tried to work on my game before the home screen, because that was wasting my time. </td>
