  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I had to persevere to understand what the untold stories were in the advert that we watched. It was a Kia advert starring hamsters for the new kia soul. I figured out the target market and subtext but struggled with the untold stories. Then we started to talk about it as a class and I got an idea. The changing of the hamsters in the ad is the changing of the car and your life if you buy it.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I had to question why certain people were there, what they were doing in the ad and what was their purpose, to determine what the target market, subtext and untold stories were in the advert.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>We were thinking by ourselves and not talking to others. The helped us be more independent in our thinking.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I am happy now that I can break down an advert or another type of media and then understand more about what they are trying to tell you in the ad.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I engaged in the lesson to get the best out of it because I consider learning about media important for us and helpful.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I could have engaged more in the lesson about the hidden story and that would have made it easier for me in the lesson.</td>

    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
