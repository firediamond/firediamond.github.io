    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>We have our blog pages and our code within these.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To fix or improve our blogs. You got a bonus if you could make your page snow.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>I started to add table rules to my blog, but didn't get my page to snow.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I had to persevere when I was looking for a moving image to put as my background that was not a GIF. In the end I found a .jpg image but I did not have time to put this image up.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I needed to question the fact that when I tried to use the GIF image as my background for snow it didn't work. I then realised that this wasnâ€™t going to work and had to use a different method. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I was independent, this week, because when I was having trouble with the moving image background, I worked on this independently.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>When I looked back on my work, not much on my blog post had changed but in my code I had done a lot of editing. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I engaged this week when I was looking at the Angry Technician blog and how the language was used and how it was laid out. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I could have worked more on the table rules than trying to find an image for the snow bonus. This would have changed my blog in a better and more efficient way. This would have also helped me with my time management by giving me less to work on at home.</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to focus on the core work of the lesson and not always go and work on the fun bit. I need to work on the harder bit but then this would mean that I get more time to relax at home.</td>
