    <td>To get as far through the instructions on the worksheet as we can</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>When the alien row wasn't in line and right underneath the other row I had to work out what was wrong. I looked around my code and found out that I had been copying the Y axis code and hadn’t made my own.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I had to question the fact that I couldn’t just copy the worksheet and it would be right. I questioned myself by thinking that Mr Keen would never let us just copy everything and that I had to actually make my own code. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>When persevering and questioning I did this by myself and without the help from peers or teachers.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>After I had finished my work at school my work on Scratch was working and where I was up to on the sheet the code was my own and it worked. I was happy with this.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I engaged in the lesson by listening how to access the worksheet and listened when there was an important part of the lesson.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I could have engaged more in the lesson by listening when Mr Kenn said that you had to answer some questions and problems along the way on the worksheet and I asked for help once because of this.</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I could engage more by listening more intently and also if you have a worksheet like this you need to read the questions more than once.</td>
    <td></td>
