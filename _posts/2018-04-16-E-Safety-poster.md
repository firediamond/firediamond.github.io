  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I did not have to persevere much this lesson. If there was any persevering that I did, it was working out how to keep my document looking grown up, smart and informative with a plain colour choice. I put a lot of thought into those things.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I questioned our teacher as to why we needed to have a picture in our document if it needs to be smart and informative. She said that it was not a necessity but sometimes visualizing something is easier than attempting to understand something through words.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I worked quite silently this lesson and did not get any of my ideas for my design from anyone else.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>The work I did was a suitable amount and it looked very smart. I have not finished yet but I hope to next lesson.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I was not turning around or talking to friends this lesson and I focused on my work so that I could get more done in the lesson. Being quiet also helped me concentrate more.</td>

    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>

    <td>I could have persevered more and I would have got more work done in the lesson but overall I was quite happy with how the lesson went.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I should always look to work as hard as I can so that I get lots of work done in the lesson. I would always prefer to be ahead of task than on task.</td>
