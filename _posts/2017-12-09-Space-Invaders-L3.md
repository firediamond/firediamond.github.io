  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>We have some previous code from past lessons on Scratch.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>For when the aliens disappear the ones next to the edge carry on to the edge and the same all the way across. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>I got started on this part but then started working on another aspect.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>When I was working out the problem with my laser on Scratch I took time thinking of the possibilities by myself and found that although I had put the code for the clone I had forgotten about the original alien.  </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I questioned the fact that when my bullet hit an alien it just vanished. This was because I hadn't told the laser that it was going to hit the alien.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I was independent because when I was working with my code I thought of the possibilities of what might have gone wrong and did not straight away ask for help.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>My work on Scratch is improving and the game is becoming more and more like the original space invaders. I was happy with this.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I engaged a bit when I was listening how we could make our work better, when Mr keen was showing us on the board, but I could have engaged more and that would have helped some of my problems that I had to work around.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I could have engaged more as I have just said and this would have helped me a lot by saving me time and effort.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>

  <tr>
    <td>I should try and use the information given to me to make me more time efficient and this would help me move on to other things faster. </td>
