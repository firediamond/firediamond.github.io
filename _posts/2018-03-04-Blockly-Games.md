  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I was really struggling on "turtle" level 6 because I couldn't work out how my pen was going to move from my third star to the white line. I tried to do it in one leap and it didn’t work. I then realised that the bottom left hand corner of my first star was parallel to the white line that I needed to be drawn. So i tried going back to my first triangle but this also didn’t work. I then realised that I didn’t have to turn my pen again and that was why it wasn't working. So then I knew how to do it. Completed the level and was very happy about it.   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I had to question why my code wasn’t working in my “pond” game. I had to look over my code lots of times. I still didn’t realise what was wrong. I then looked very carefully and found that I had missed one curly bracket and that was why it wasn’t working.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I was working independently because I worked my problems out by myself and did not use anything other than the small instructions at the start of the levels to help me.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td> Was happy what I had done on “maze” and “turtle” but I did not do much on “pond” as I did not have a lot of time. Although I did get through a few levels.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I had to be engaged when I was working on Blockly Games because they are hard coding problems to crack. I engaged and got all the way to level 10 on maze but could not figure out how to complete it with the limited amount of code I was allowed to use.</td>

    <td>I could have tried to manage my time better so that I had more of an opportunity to make more code and complete more levels in “pond”. </td>

    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>

    <td>I could try and manage my time better and focus on all of my things that I have to complete, not just the first ones that I do.</td>
