    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I had to work out why having social media on your phone could be a disadvantage and effect your life. After watching the video I worked out that being on your phone too much can lead to being antisocial. This is not good for yourself or others and can make others feel left out if the don't have a phone.   </td>

  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I had to question why having social media on your phone could be so bad. But actually seeing people being really antisocial shows you how difficult it is to have a simple conversation.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>Although we were doing group work in this lesson I spoke about my own ideas when I put up my hand. Saying your own ideas to the class helps you know if they are good or not quite what our teacher was asking.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I am happy that I now understand more about how we should not constantly be on our phones and when someone addresses us we should listen and not look at a screen.</td>

    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>When you listen to your teacher and what others have to sat you get a lot more out of the lesson then if you had not.</td>
