  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To be able to understand when it is alright to exaggerate about your personality and when you probably should tell the truth, on social media.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>I now know that lying about yourself on social media may not be the best thing to do. You will create a false personality that will not be true.</td>
  </tr>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I do like to be quite private online and not tell people about myself at all, but I now understand that making lots of lies will not help you. However, it is ok to exaggerate a little about yourself. For instance, you could say "I went on the best water slide in the world today" although it was only alright. This would be fine. But you could not go round telling people you were a 23 year old man called Dave if you were not that person at all.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I had to question why even something such as a selfie could be a lie. With selfies, if you have the right makeup and take it from the right angle you could make yourself look beautiful. But you might not be attractive at all.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>When you are in class you are with your friends and teachers. However, when we are on social media we have to be independent and mature. We have to make the right decisions and not do silly things online.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I am happy that I understand more about fake identities and I shall try to be as truthful as I can on social media. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I engaged enough to now understand more about how having a false personality is not a good idea.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I should probably contribute more in the lessons and be more eager to put my hand up as there is nothing bad about trying and getting something wrong.</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will contribute more in the lesson and not be scared of putting my hand up.</td>
