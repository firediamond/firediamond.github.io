    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I struggled with Scratch a bit because it was my third time using it but I didn't give up and carried on with the lesson.</td>

    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>When I was playing Donkey Kong I was confused when the game didn’t let me move. So I tried a few thing like pressing different buttons and it still didn’t work. So I put in on the internet the question. By reading all the things people had said I came to a conclusion that the answer was by pressing the game multiple times and this worked. </td>

    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>My work on Scratch worked and when looking back on it I did okay in the lesson and on Scratch</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I engaged in the lesson by looking at the board enough to remember how to create good code on Scratch and I also listened enough about the homework so in this section I will also list the sprites and variables in the retro games I played:
Donkey kong: sprites: Donkey Kong, Princess Peach, Mario, barrels small fire sprite near Donkey Kong. Variables: score, level, lives and bonus.
Tetris: sprites: the shapes. Variables: score lines and levels.
Frogger: sprites: the frog, cars, trucks, flies, logs and turtles. Variables: score, lives and time.
Q*bert: sprites: Q*bert, balls and the snake. Variables: lives and score.
Super Mario Bros.: sprites: Mario, Luigi, flowers, small brom gremlins and the turtle. Variables: score and lives.</td>
