  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>We had to think of how the advantages of social media could also link to other disadvantages and vice versa. It was sometimes hard to think that some really helpful things like being able to communicate with friends and show them what you are doing can lead to bullying.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I had to question everything. You always have to when you are looking at the media as many things we hear are false or are trying to manipulate us. But, I do know, from past experience, that social media can lead to things such as grooming and I thoroughly agree that this is wrong.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I came up with new ideas, all by myself, as what could be bad but may be good for some people. Meeting new people on social media might be great for some people, but others may think talking to someone you haven't met in real  life is a bad idea.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I am happy that I can now be more careful on social media, but still know that you don't have to not go on it at all to stay safe.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I listened to others ideas and that has also helped me get more ideas of how to have fun, but stay safe. Listening to others can sometimes really help you.</td>

    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I should have probably questioned what my teacher said, as even he may not know the truth. I need to look at as many sources as I can to help me get a good understanding of what we are learning about.</td>

    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>

    <td>I need to go home after a lesson and check out some of the things that I have been told in the lesson and build an opinion of my own about that topic.</td>
